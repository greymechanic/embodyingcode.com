> Not talking about this [G Code](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=G+Code). We live by the real [G-code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-code). We rely on the screens, we do battle in Processing, I was born in the G-Code, embedded in my blood.

*here's what we'll cover:*

- Processing check-in
- Head over to the IO Lab for a Gctrl demo
- Spend the morning planning how to use Gctrl
- Spend the afternoon in the lab testing Gctrl
