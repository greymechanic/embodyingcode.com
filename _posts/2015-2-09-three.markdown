> Software is deeply woven into contemporary life—economically, culturally,
creatively, politically—in manners both obvious and nearly invisible. Yet
while much is written about how software is used, and the activities that
it supports and shapes, thinking about software itself has remained largely
technical for much of its history. Increasingly, however, artists, scientists,
engineers, hackers, designers, and scholars in the humanities and social
sciences are finding that for the questions they face, and the things they
need to build, an expanded understanding of software is necessary. For
such understanding they can call upon a strand of texts in the history of
computing and new media, they can take part in the rich implicit culture of
software, and they can also take part in the development of an emerging,
fundamentally transdisciplinary, computational literacy. These provide the
foundation for software studies.
